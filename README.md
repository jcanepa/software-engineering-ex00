# Software Engineering Exercise 0: Code Self-Check

A simple app that demonstrates basic software engineering proficiency.  

Once [Ruby](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruby) is installed on your machine, you may run the program from the project directory:

`ruby app.rb`  

You will be prompted to enter a math operation followed by two numbers. Valid operations are:

- `add`
- `sub`
- `mul`
- `div`

Operations can be performed like so: `add 2 3`.  

Once you are done, you can exit the app by typing `quit`.
